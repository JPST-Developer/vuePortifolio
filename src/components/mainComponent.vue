        <p>Back in 2012, IV decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit
          hole
          of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an
          advertising agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge corporation.

          My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. In my free
          time
          I've also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the
          Spotify API.

          When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running
          around
